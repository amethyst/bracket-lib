//! The `bracket-embedding` crate is used to provide resource embedding.
//! This allows you to include binary assets inside your program when shipping,
//! with no external files. This can be especially useful for WASM builds.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bracket_embedding::prelude::*;
//!
//! embedded_resource!(SOURCE_FILE, "embedding.rs");
//!
//! fn main() {
//!    // This helper macro links the above embedding, allowing it to be accessed as a resource from various parts of the program.
//!    link_resource!(SOURCE_FILE, "embedding.rs");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This crate isn't very useful on its own, but is heavily used by the other parts of `bracket-lib`.
