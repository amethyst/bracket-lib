# Welcome to RLTK_RS, the Rust implementation of RLTK

You can find the original C++ project here: [https://github.com/thebracket/rltk](https://github.com/thebracket/rltk).

To use this, you will want to have a working `Rust` and `Cargo` setup. On Windows, [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) should get you going.

If you'd like to see a functional roguelike that uses `rltk_rs`, check out [Rusty Roguelike](https://github.com/thebracket/rustyroguelike). It was built for the 2019 */r/roguelikedev does the complete roguelike tutorial* event, and implements the [TCOD Tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/) - but using RLTK. It started out as the home of this project, which was then spun off into a separate crate.

You can read a tutorial series on writing a Roguelike with this library at: [http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/](http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/)

## A note on 0.6.0: it breaks things, but I feel it's worth it.

If you want to keep your code-base as-is, lock your version in `cargo.toml` to `0.5.17`. You can do this with:

```toml
[dependencies]
rltk = "=0.5.17"
```

It's worth upgrading, however:

* There's fixes for "sticky" ctrl/alt/shift modifiers (and you can now read them as a key - thanks to `bofh69`).
* The `BaseMap2D` and `Algorithm2D` systems have been overhauled to require considerably less type casting in actual use. All of the traits that refer to a tile index now return a `usize` rather than an `i32`. That eliminates a whole class of `idx as usize` casting in most client code. Unfortunately, it will require that you update your code to match.
* `Algorithm2D` now supports a `dimensions` function, returning a `Point`. (`fn dimensions(&self) -> Point`). If you implement this, the rest of the trait can automatically implement `point2d_to_index`, `index_to_point2d` and `in_bounds` for you - so long as you're okay with my preferred array striding (2D array, rows of X values). If you don't like it, you can implement them and use your preferred storage scheme.
* Likewise, the path-finding functions that previously returned `i32` indices now return `usize`.
* There's a bunch of `try_into` added into various functions to relax the types they require. I believe this needs one of the newer Rust setups, so make sure you update the language.
* I've updated all the examples to use the new scheme. The [Roguelike Tutorial](http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/) has also been updated to work with the new setup.

6.0.1 additionally renamed the "specs" feature to `ecs` and the "serialization" feature `serde` in accordance with guidelines.

## Running the examples

The examples use Cargo's built-in support for example code. E.g. To run example 1, enter: `cargo run --example ex01-helloworld`.

## Using RLTK in your project

In your `Cargo.toml` file, include the following:

```toml
[dependencies]
rltk = "0.6.2"
```

*Note: we don't do that in the example files, we use a relative path - to avoid having nested git repos.*

Copy all the files from the `resources` directory inside RLTK into your own `resources` folder. RLTK needs to be able to load the font file and OpenGL shaders.

For the simplest possible *Hello World*, your source code (`main.rs`) can look like this:

```rust
extern crate rltk;
use rltk::{Rltk, GameState, Console};

struct State {}
impl GameState for State {
    fn tick(&mut self, ctx : &mut Rltk) {
        ctx.cls();
        ctx.print(1, 1, "Hello RLTK World");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let context = Rltk::init_simple8x8(80, 50, "Hello RLTK World", "resources");
    let gs = State{ };
    rltk::main_loop(context, gs);
}
```

### Advanced Usage: multiple back-ends

RLTK supports a number of *feature flags* to let you use it the way you want.

* If you remove default features, it goes into "dummy" mode. The game state and rendering functions are disabled, but all of the library functions are available (and the lib becomes *tiny* - dropping most of its dependencies).
* By default, the `opengl` feature will use WebGL or native OpenGL to render your consoles with a pseudo-terminal.
* You can disable `opengl` and enable `curses` to render to `ncurses` or `pdcurses` (depending upon your platform). All of the demos are available as console-only now, via `cargo run --example curses14-dwarfmap --features curses --no-default-features` (substitute `curses` for `ex` in the example names, and specify the feature set).
* You can disable `opengl` and enable `amethyst_engine_vulkan` or `amethyst_engine_metal` to render via the [Amethyst game engine](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst). The examples are prefixed with `av` and `am` (for Vulkan and Metal respectively). For example, `cargo run --example av13-textblock --no-default-features --features amethyst_engine_vulkan` will run example 13 on Vulkan.

## Examples

### Example 1: Bouncing Hello World

![Animated GIF](/screenshots/RLTK_RS_EXAMPLE01.gif)

[Example 1 - Hello World](examples/ex01-helloworld.rs) is a small example, showing off a simple 8x8 console, and the boilerplate required to make RLTK run.

Run this example with `cargo run --example ex01-helloworld` from the root of the cloned repository.

[Run this example in your browser - requires WebGL2](http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/ex01/)

### Example 2: Multiple console layers

![Animated GIF](/screenshots/RLTK_RS_EXAMPLE02.gif)

[Example 2 - Sparse Layers](examples/ex02-sparse.rs) is very similar to example 1, but it adds an additional layer - in a VGA 8x16 font, and renders the FPS and frame rate to it. This illustrates how easy it is to work with layers in RLTK.

Run this example with `cargo run --example ex02-sparse` from the root of the cloned repository.

### Example 3: Walking around

![Animated GIF](/screenshots/RLTK_RS_EXAMPLE03.gif)

[Example 3 - Walking Around](examples/ex03-walking.rs) is the first step for a lot of roguelikes: we generate a random map (very random in this case), render the player as an `@`, and move him/her/it around with the cursor keys or numpad. This illustrates the simple keyboard input mechanism, and also how to handle basic game state.

Run this example with `cargo run --example ex03-walking` from the root of the cloned repository.

### Example 4: Field of view

![Animated GIF](/screenshots/RLTK_RS_EXAMPLE04.gif)

[Example 4 - Field of View/FOV](examples/ex04-fov.rs) takes example 3, and adds field-of-view. To do this, it implements some traits from the RLTK library that allow it to provide helpers such as this.

Run this example with `cargo run --example ex04-fov` from the root of the cloned repository.

### Example 5: Auto-explore with Dijkstra Flow Maps

![Animated GIF](/screenshots/RLTK_RS_EXAMPLE05-2.gif)

[Example 5 - Auto-explore with Dijkstra Flow Maps](examples/ex05-dijkstra.rs) creates a random map, with a lot more walls. It uses RLTK's Dijkstra Flow Maps (see [this article](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=The_Incredible_Power_of_Dijkstra_Maps)) to solve an auto-explore problem for the map. I recommend compiling this one with `cargo run --release` - debug mode lacks a lot of optimizations and runs really slowly. (RLTK's Dijkstra implementation automatically uses a parallel algorithm for large numbers of targets).

Run this example with `cargo run --example ex05-dijkstra --release` from the root of the cloned repository. (The `--release` tells it to optimize the build; it's pretty slow without optimizations)

### Example 6: A-Star pathing and mouse control

![Animated GIF](/screenshots/RLTK_RS_EXAMPLE06.gif)

[Example 6 - A Star with the Mouse](examples/ex06-astar-mouse.rs) lets you use A-Star navigation to traverse a random map. Mouse over a destination, and your path is highlighted. Click, and the little @ runs there.

Run this example with `cargo run --example ex06-astar-mouse` from the root of the cloned repository.

### Example 7: Layered Tiles

![Animated GIF](/screenshots/RLTK_RS_EXAMPLE07.gif)

[Example 7 - Tiles](examples/ex07-tiles.rs) shows how you can use the font system for tiles. It creates two layers with the same font; the base layer is used for the map, and the second layer is drawn in "no background" mode to seamlessly overlay sprites atop the map without ugly borders. It uses the FOV code from example 4 to show how to recolor sprites, and uses a distance function to give a lighting effect.

Run this example with `cargo run --example ex07-tiles` from the root of the cloned repository.

### Example 8: REX Paint Support

![Animated GIF](/screenshots/RLTK_RS_EXAMPLE08.jpg)

[Example 8 - REX Paint Support](examples/ex08-rex.rs) demonstrates loading a `.xp` file (created with
GridSageGames' excellent [REX Paint](https://www.gridsagegames.com/rexpaint/)), and displaying it on the console. Thanks to Mara "Alkahest"'s hard work (see original repo [here](https://gitlab.com/medusacle/rs-rexpaint)), you can load and save `.xp` files as you need them.

Run this example with `cargo run --example ex08-rex` from the root of the cloned repository.

### Example 9: Layer Offsets

![Animated GIF](/screenshots/RLTK_RS_EXAMPLE09.jpg)

[Example 9 - Offsets](examples/ex09-offsets.rs) demonstrates the ability to call `set_offset` on a console layer, to nudge it in a direction. In this case, it is used to render thin walls *between* the major tiles.

Run this example with `cargo run --example ex09-offsets` from the root of the cloned repository.

### Example 10: Post Process Effects

![Animated GIF](/screenshots/RLTK_RS_EXAMPLE10.gif)

[Example 10 - Post Process](examples/ex10-postprocess.rs) shows off the post-processing system built into RLTK. Scanlines, and optional screen-burn can be enabled for the truly retro experience.

Run this example with `cargo run --example ex10-postprocess` from the root of the cloned repository.

### Example 11: Dice Rolling

![Animated GIF](/screenshots/RLTK_RS_EXAMPLE11.gif)

[Example 11 - Random](examples/ex11-random.rs) demonstrates how RLTK wraps the `rand` crate to give a more accessible random number generator. The demo plots the distribution of a series of `3d6` rolls.

Run this example with `cargo run --example ex11-random` from the root of the cloned repository.

### Example 12: Simplex Noise

![Animated GIF](/screenshots/RLTK_RS_EXAMPLE12.gif)

[Example 12 - Simplex Noise](examples/ex12-simplex.rs) demonstrates the port of [Auburn's FastNoise library](https://github.com/Auburns/FastNoise) to Rust (included in RLTK, because every Roguelike tooklit should have noise). It cycles through seeds and regenerates the terrain periodically.

Run this example with `cargo run --example ex12-simplex` from the root of the cloned repository.

### Example 13: Formatting blocks

![Animated GIF](/screenshots/RLTK_RS_EXAMPLE13.jpg)

[Example 13 - Text Blocks](examples/ex13-textblock.rs) demonstrates the `TextBlock` functionality for easily wrapping a set of formatting commands into a command sequence,
and then rendering them together. This is useful for large amounts of text.

Run this example with `cargo run --example ex13-textblock` from the root of the cloned repository.

[Run this example in your browser - requires WebGL2](http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/ex13/)

### Example 14: Dwarf Fortress-Style 3D

![Animated GIF](/screenshots/RLTK_RS_EXAMPLE14.gif)

[Example 14 - Dwarf Fortress-Style 3D](examples/ex14-dwarfmap.rs) uses the `Algorithm3D` trait to provide A* pathing in three dimensions, and implements a simple Dwarf Fortress (with DFHack "layer diving") renderer to display a noise-generated 3D map and traverse it. This also uses the noise system.

Run this example with `cargo run --example ex14-dwarfmap` from the root of the cloned repository.

### Example 15: SPECS

![Animated GIF](/screenshots/RLTK_RS_EXAMPLE15.gif)

[Example 15 - SPECS](examples/ex15-specs.rs) uses the Entity Component System SPECS, alongside RLTK, to implement the old DOS game *Bouncing Babies*. It illustrates how to setup SPECS and do very simple integration to render a simple console-based game.

[Run this example in your browser - requires WebGL2](http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/ex15/)

### Example 16: Obtaining key codes

[Example 16 - Keyboard](examples/ex16-keyboard.rs) provides a handy tool to grab keyboard codes and see how to use the `shift`, `control` and `alt` keys as modifiers or keyboard inputs.

[Run this example in your browser - requires WebGL2](http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/ex16/)

### Example 17 (Web Assembly Only): Binding HTML Buttons

[Example 17 - External HTML Buttons](examples/ex17-wasm-external.rs) demonstrates the new (as of 0.5.0) ability to add bindings to buttons on the HTML hosting the web assembly, and have them fire events in the new `web_button` context field.

## Building with WASM

RLTK newly supports web assembly (`WASM`). It's still rough around the edges, but it works. The build process ends up being a bit involved:

1. Build the example with a specified target: `cargo build --example ex01-helloworld --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release`
2. Use `wasm-bindgen` to build bindings: `wasm-bindgen .\target\wasm32-unknown-unknown\release\examples\ex01-helloworld.wasm --out-dir <YOUR WEB DIRECTORY> --no-modules --no-typescript`
3. Include an HTML file like the one in `wasm_help/index.html`. This one requires that you rename your `.wasm` and `js` file to `myblob_bg.wasm` and `myblob.js` - or adjust the HTML file to match your filenames.

I use this batch file (I'm on Windows) to build them all:

```bat
