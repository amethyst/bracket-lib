# bracket-terminal

`bracket-terminal` is part of the `bracket-lib` family. It provides a virtual ASCII/Codepage-437 terminal (with optional tile graphic support and layers), and a game loop. This frees you up from implementation difficulties, making it easy to write grid-based games (Roguelikes are a great fit, but any grid/tile-based game can work). It also provides assistance with keyboard and mouse input.

Bracket-terminal supports multiple back-ends:

* The default is `OpenGL`, which works on just about everything. The GL back-end supports all features, including post-processing (retro screen effects) and layers.
* The `WebGL` (WASM) back-end works in Web Assembly, allowing you to compile your `bracket-terminal`-based game for the web.
* The `webgpu` back-ends provide rendering in `Vulkan`, `Metal`, and `WebGPU`. It currently supports everything except the post-processing effects.
* The `crossterm` back-end runs natively in your existing terminal. Graphical features are not supported.
* The `curses` back-end runs natively in *NIX terminals, or in a `pdcurses` terminal emulator on Windows. Graphical features are not supported.

**BREAKING CHANGE ALERT**: The `crossterm` feature is now `cross_term` if you are using `bracket-terminal` directly. It's still `crossterm` for `bracket-lib` and `rltk`.

## Why `bracket-terminal` and not direct console rendering?

Bracket-terminal can do terminal rendering, but if that is your only target you may be better off using `crossterm`. Bracket-terminal gets you a few features you don't find elsewhere:

* It is game-loop based, so it is ideal for frame-oriented game programming.
* Codepage-437 emulation is sprite-based on graphical back-ends. You can be absolutely sure that your game will look the same on all platforms, using *exactly* the font(s) you specify.
* It provides multiple layers, which can use different font/sprite files.
* There are some retro post-processing effects available if you like them.
* `bracket-terminal` works hard to be simple and straightforward, making for a great learning environment.

## Minimal example

The following code is enough to put `Hello Minimal Bracket World` on the screen:

```rust
use bracket_terminal::prelude::*;

struct State {}

impl GameState for State {
    fn tick(&mut self, ctx: &mut BTerm) {
        ctx.print(1, 1, "Hello Bracket World");
    }
}

fn main() -> BError {
    let context = BTermBuilder::simple80x50()
        .with_title("Hello Minimal Bracket World")
        .build()?;

    let gs: State = State {};
    main_loop(context, gs)
}
```

It's worth noting that `(0,0)` in `bracket-terminal` is the top-left of the screen.

## Examples

Run an example with `cargo run --example <name>`.

* `hello_minimal` puts "Hello Minimal Bracket World" on the screen. [Try it with WASM](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/hello_minimal/)
* `hello_terminal` puts a bouncing "Hello World" on the screen in color, with frames-per-second [FPS] counting, and frame-rate limiting. [Try it with WASM](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/hello_terminal/)
* `sparse` is the same demo, but with a second layer in a VGA 8x16 font on a second layer, no frame-rate limiting, and utilizing batched command submission. [Try it with WASM](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/sparse/)
* `walking` lets you use your keyboard to walk an `@` symbol around a random map. [Try it with WASM](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/walking/)
* `astar-mouse` lets you use your mouse to move around a random map, using A-Star pathing (from the `bracket-pathfinding` crate) to avoid obstacles. [Try it with WASM](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/astar_mouse/)
* `tiles` is similar to the `walking` demo, but uses two layers of graphical tiles (graphical back-ends only). [Try it with WASM](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/tiles/)
* `rex` demonstrates loading a sprite from [REX Paint](https://www.gridsagegames.com/rexpaint/) and rendering it to the terminal. [Try it with WASM](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/rex/)
* `postprocess` demonstrates the library's post-processing effects - scan lines and screen burn. [Try it with WASM](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/postprocess/)
* `textblock` demonstrates the `TextBlock` system, giving you a "builder" approach to constructing larger blocks of text with word-wrapping and formatting. [Try it with WASM](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/textblock/)
* `dwarfmap` demonstrates using the terminal with `Algorithm3D` to provide a Dwarf Fortress style 3D map (2D "slices" of a 3D world). It uses the `bracket-noise` library for terrain generation. [Try it with WASM](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/dwarfmap/)
* `keyboard` demonstrates keyboard scan-code input. It's mostly useful for debugging. [Try it with WASM](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/keyboard/)
* `textsprites` demonstrates multi-tile sprites. [Try it with WASM](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/textsprites/)
* `native_gl` shows you how to access OpenGL directly. Only works with `opengl` back-ends, WASM or native. [Try it with WASM](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/wasmtest/native_gl/)

## Running the examples with other back-ends

You can run the `dwarfmap` example with different back-ends like this. The same principle applies to other back-ends:

* *OpenGL* : `cargo run --example dwarfmap`
* *WGPU*: `cargo run --example dwarfmap --no-default-features --features "webgpu"`
* *Curses*: `cargo run --example dwarfmap --no-default-features --features "curses"`
* *Crossterm*: (note that the feature is called `cross_term`) `cargo run --example dwarfmap --no-default-features --features "cross_term"`
